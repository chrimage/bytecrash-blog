# ðŸš¨ Cloudflare Pages Build Fix

## Issue: Hugo Extended Error

If you see this error in Cloudflare Pages build logs:
```
ERROR TOCSS: failed to transform "style.scss" (text/x-scss). Check your Hugo installation; you need the extended version to build SCSS/SASS
```

## âœ… Solution 1: Enable Hugo Extended (Recommended)

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**
2. **Select your project** (`bytecrash-blog`)
3. **Go to Settings â†’ Environment variables**
4. **Add these variables:**

| Variable Name | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| `HUGO_VERSION` | `0.142.0` |
| `HUGO_EXTENDED` | `true` |

5. **Save the variables**
6. **Go to Deployments tab**
7. **Click "Retry deployment" on the latest build**

## âœ… Solution 2: Automatic Fallback (Already Implemented)

The repository now includes automatic fallbacks that work with standard Hugo:

- **Custom CSS**: Fallback styling when SCSS isn't available
- **Image Processing**: Simplified avatar handling without Hugo Extended features
- **Conditional Logic**: Automatically detects Hugo version and adapts

This means the site **should build successfully** even without Hugo Extended, though with slightly reduced styling.

## âœ… Verification

### With Hugo Extended:
```
âœ… Detected the following tools from environment: nodejs@20.19.2, hugo@0.142.0
âœ… Start building sites â€¦
âœ… Total in XXX ms
âœ… Success: Finished building
```

### With Standard Hugo (Fallback):
```
âœ… Start building sites â€¦
âœ… Total in XXX ms (using fallback CSS)
âœ… Success: Finished building
```

## ðŸ”„ If Still Failing

1. **Check the latest build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Try a manual redeploy**: Make a small commit and push
3. **Verify environment variables** are saved correctly
4. **Contact support** with build logs if issues persist

## Issue: Wrangler Deploy Error

If you see this error:
```
âœ˜ [ERROR] Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory
```

**Solution**: Remove the deploy command entirely. Cloudflare Pages automatically deploys static sites after the build completes.

- **Build command**: `hugo --minify`
- **Deploy command**: *(leave empty)*
- **Output directory**: `public`

`wrangler deploy` is for Cloudflare Workers, not Pages.

Welcome to **ByteCrash**, a blog focused on practical engineering, automation, and software development. This space is a mix of documentation, experimentation, and analysis—mostly centered on the tools and systems I work with or explore in my spare time.

## What to Expect

- **Technical How-Tos** – Step-by-step guides on Linux, automation, and software architecture  
- **Project Logs** – Notes and outcomes from personal and professional builds  
- **AI + Automation** – Experiments in LLMs, pipelines, and workflow optimization  
- **Infrastructure & DevOps** – From hypervisors and networking to system hardening and orchestration  
- **Occasional Opinions** – On tools, tradeoffs, and the direction of modern tech

## About Me

I'm Chris — a Linux Systems Engineer with a focus on infrastructure, automation, and pragmatic problem-solving.  
I write here to clarify my thinking, document useful patterns, and occasionally share things I wish I’d found online earlier.
